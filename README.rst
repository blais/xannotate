xannotate: Xlib Transparent Screen Annotator
============================================

.. contents:: Table of Contents

Description
===========

xannotate is a simple program that opens a screen-size window over whatever is
present and allows you to scribble over it.  This is useful when you are doing a
demo and you need to annotate parts of what is on-screen.

Credits
-------

This program was not written from scratch, but rather just a hacked and
trimmed-down version of `WayV <http://www.stressbunny.com/wayv>`_.  All credits
go to the authors of WayV.  All I did was remove the unnecessary parts for my
the simpler application goals, to just scribble over the screen.

Invocation
----------

The program takes no arguments and start immediately, without feedback.  Use the
mouse's Button 1 to scribble. Press the Escape key to exit silently.

Most typically, you would bind a function key in your window manager to invoke
this during a demo.

Martin Blais did the hacking on WayV to dumb it down for the desired feature set
of this specific application, otherwise all credits go to the original authors
