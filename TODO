TODO: xannotate
===============


- Modify xannotate to exit on any key and not send back the key on the Escape

- Make lines wider

- Try to rewrite xannotate but using PyGame and PIL, with a mass-spring
  system

- convert to Python using PyGame and PIL

- the drawing should use dynamics like the spring-mass drawing program from
  P.Haeberli

- we could have algorithms that analyze the image to construct blocks
  automatically

- drawing should be more subtle than XOR
